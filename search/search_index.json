Follow the instructions below to set up your Python environment. The only requirement is that you have to do this before the course! Feel free to contact Callum if you have any problems with the installation (but better google them first!) Note: the course is designed in Python 3.7 , but for most cases will work in Python 3.6 too. 1. Install Python distribution using Anaconda 1.1. Download Anaconda with Python 3.7 for your OS . If you have a Cefas laptop, install Python from the Cefas Software Centre. 1.2. Install it following these instructions 2. Download course materials The material for the workshop can be directly downloaded as a zip file or can be cloned from our GitHub repository . Option 1: Download ZIP file Download the materials as a zip file and unpack it in a suitable directory, for example, in Downloads folder. Option 2: Using Git 2.1. Install Git If you don't have git version control system installed, you can install it following these instructions: Linux Use your package manager. For example, using aptitude you would run the following terminal command: sudo apt-get install git Mac The XCode command line tools need to be installed. Install XCode if it isn\u2019t already. XCode is available in the Mac App Store for free. Launch XCode and accept the license agreement. Quit XCode. Open a new terminal and run the command xcode-select --install Select install on the pop-up menu. Windows Download and install the GitHub desktop tools . 2.2. Clone the repository 2.2.1. Open the command line (terminal or cmd.exe) 2.2.2. (Linux or Mac, optional) Change to a suitable directory (e.g. /home/yourname/Documents ) 2.2.3. Clone the repo by typing On Linux or Mac: git clone https://github.com/ueapy/pythoncourse2019-materials.git On Windows: github clone https://github.com/ueapy/pythoncourse2019-materials.git This should create a local copy of the course materials in the current directory. Windows-users, double check that it is cloned in the directory you want. 3. Create the environment 3.1. Make sure Anaconda is installed and the course materials are downloaded 3.2. Open the command line (e.g., OS X terminal on Mac; Anaconda prompt on Windows) 3.3. Navigate to the cloned / downloaded folder (using cd command), for example: cd C:\\Users\\myname\\Downloads\\pythoncourse2019-materials\\ 3.4. Create the environment using conda package manager: conda env create -f environment.yml This will take some time depending on your Internet speed (<15 minutes). 4. Activate the environment Linux / Mac If your default shell is NOT bash, first type bash . Activate the relevant environment by typing: source activate course2019 Windows Still in the command line (Anaconda prompt), type: activate course2019 5. Launch Jupyter Once the environment is activated, type jupyter notebook in the command line. This should open Jupyter Notebook in your browser. Still having troubles? If you are unable to install Anaconda Python 3.7 on your PC, contact the course organisers . Another option: launch the course in a cloud!","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation-instructions","text":"For this workshop you need to install Python on your laptop!
